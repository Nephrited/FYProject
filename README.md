Leap Motion Controller for Windows
=========

This was my 2013-2014 Final Year Project for my BSc.

Proof of concept of computer control using the Leap Motion, implemented using the Leap API.

This code runs in Java, but requires the Leap motion drivers and hardware to be present on the machine.

Things to mention:

Native Libraries - Code is platform specific. Eclipse seems to hate them also. Have to be put in the Jar directory.
Switch to make the code listen when tabbed out.
Shortcuts have to have waits to stop them flipping out.
